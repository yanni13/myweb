    <p>
        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
        that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS.</span>
        As of 2022, 98% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span>  on the client side for webpage behavior, 
        often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> 
        engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span>  is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
        that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based 
        object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, 
        functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document 
        Object Model (DOM).
